- `Response.ok`
- `Response.status`
- `Response.url`
- `Response.headers`

   There are key ones but mainly ; Response.status is sending feedback of the result of attempting to connect.

   Informational responses (100 – 199)
   Successful responses (200 – 299)
   Redirection messages (300 – 399)
   Client error responses (400 – 499)
   Server error responses (500 – 599)
   Important ones to know are 200, 201, 204, 404, and 500

   Outputs the final URL after any redirects
4. `Response.headers` -
   A response header in HTTP is a component of the response sent by a server to a client. It contains metadata about the response, type of content being returned, the length, server details, among other information.

These headers help the client understand how to process the response.
