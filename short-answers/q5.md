# Question

What are the two arguments that we pass into `fetch` and what do they do? What does `fetch` return?

# Answer

First argument is a `string URL`, this allows us to attempt a connection with a URL to use their API

Second argument comes afterwards and is optional. you would not need to make one if you are just looking to grab data from the URL.
The second argument includes information regarding your request.

Using `.then`following up a successful connection
Usually using two `.then's`
the first to return the response method that retrieves your data, and the second then() to actually work with the data.

`fetch` returns a Promise that resolves to the Response to that request
