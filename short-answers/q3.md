Who sends the HTTP status code: the client or the server? What is the point of the status code?

Server"Every Response that we receive from a server"

The status code indicates how the request was processed.

"Was the resource found and returned? Was the resource not found? What there an error? Did the POST request successfully create a new resource?"
